# Overview
This CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) mobile application is created using Flutter. This application is inspired by any existing To-Do-List applications, especially Google Task as I mainly use that in my daily basis. This application is created to make it easier for users to organize their tasks or works.

# Explanation
1. `main.dart`
This is the entry point of this application. In `MyApp` class, it stated that the main application structure is build using stateless widget. In that class also defined the theme and sets the home screen to `TaskList`, which is where the tasks will be displayed.
2.`task_list.dart`
This file manages the list of the tasks. It uses `List<Task>` to hold the tasks and defines methods for adding, updating, deleting, and toggling tasks.
3. `add_task.dart`
This file handles adding and editing tasks. The state variables mantains controllers for text input, deadline, due time, and sub-tasks.
4. `task_detail.dart`
This file displays the details of a selected task. The state management initializes the current task and updates the UI when the task is modified.
5. `task_item.dart`
This file defines how each task is displayed in the list.
6. `task.dart`
This file defines the data models for tasks andd sub-tasks. `SubTask` class represents a sub-task with an ID, title, and completion status. `Task` class represents a task with various properties (ID, title, description, completion status, deadline, due time, and list of sub-tasks)
